Experimenting with a minimal project setup using webpack

Based on info in: 

- http://david-barreto.com/configuring-webpack-with-typescript/.
- https://alejandronapoles.com/2016/03/12/the-simplest-webpack-and-express-setup/
- official webpack doc (https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

Some commands:

'npm run build' will bundle everything into a single js file that can be execuded with node
'npm start' or 'npm run start' is same as 'node server.js' and will starts the server
'npm run dev' will build and start the server
